Prayer to Tārā: A Sevenfold Supplication for Protection
by Drikung Kyobpa Jikten Sumgön

ma kyewa mepé chöying na
I pray to celestial Tārā, the exalted mother,
yum jetsün lhamo drolma shyuk
Who abides within the uncreated dharmadhātu,
dé semchen kün la dé ter ma
From where she bestows comfort and joy upon all:
dak jikpa kün lé kyab tu sol
Protect me from all fear.

rang chöku yinpar ma shepar
I pray to the divine mother Tārā:
sem nyönmong wang du gyurpa yi
Through not realizing our innate nature to be dharmakāya,
ma khorwar khyampé semchen la
Our minds remain under the influence of destructive emotion;
yum lhamo khyö kyi kyab tu sol
Protect all of us who wander aimlessly in saṃsāra.

chö nying né gyü la ma kyepar
I pray to the genuine deity, mother Tārā:
tanyé tsik gi jé drang né
Protect us in whose hearts the genuine dharma hasn’t been born,
drubta ngenpé lüpa la
Who fixate on words and ideas,
yum yangdak gi lhamö kyab tu sol
Or who have been deceived by false claims.

tokpar kawa rang gi sem
I pray to the deity of mindfulness, mother Tārā:
tong né gompar mi jepar
Protect us who have glimpsed the nature of mind, so difficult to realize,
jawa ngenpé yengwa la
And yet, due to lack of mindfulness and familiarity,
yum drenpé lhamö kyab tu sol
Remain distracted by negative action.

sem rangjung nyimé yeshe la
I pray to the deity who is inseparable from my mind, mother Tārā:
nyisu dzinpé bakchak kyi
Protect us whose strong adherence to and grasping at subject-object duality
jitar jé kyang chingpa nam
Blinds us from realizing
tuk nyimé kyi lhamö kyab tu sol
The true nature of mind, non-dual wisdom.

yangdak gi dön la né jé kyang
I pray to the deity of omniscience, mother Tārā:
gyundré kyi tendrel mishepé
Protect us who, even though we abide in the midst of reality
shejé dön la mongpa la
Fail to recognise cause and effect and mutual dependence
yum künkhyen gyi lhamö kyab tu sol
And thus remain in confusion.

trödral namkhé tsennyi chen
I pray to the fully awakened deity, mother Tārā:
tamché dé dang yermé kyi
Protect us who still remain unaware of the inseparability
dadung lobmé gangzak la
Of the unelaborate, sky-like nature,
yum dzok sangyé kyi kyab tu sol
And everything it pervades.

Whilst residing at the Echung Cave, the great master Jigten Gönpo beheld the faces of seven
forms of Tārā. He supplicated them with these seven verses, which became renowned as A Prayer
to Tārā: A Seven-Fold Supplication for Protection and which carries great blessing.
