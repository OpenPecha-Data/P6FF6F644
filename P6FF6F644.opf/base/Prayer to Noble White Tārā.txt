A Prayer to Noble White Tārā
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

rabkar da shyün tong gi langtso chen
Brilliant white, with the vibrant vigor of a thousand moons,
tsenpé ku chok chidak dü chom ma
In your supreme form of major and minor marks, you are the destroyer of Māra, Lord of Death,
tsé dang yeshe ngödrub chok terwa
And bestower of the supreme siddhis of longevity and wisdom—
jetsün yishyin khorlor solwa deb
Noble Tārā, Wish-Fulfilling Wheel, to you I pray!
om taré tuttaré turé soha
oṃ tāre tuttāre ture svāhā

These are the blessed words of Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö.
