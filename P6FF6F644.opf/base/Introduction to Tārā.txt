Introduction to Tārā

by Stefan Mang

As suggested by her name, which can be translated as “Savior,”[1] Tārā became revered as a deity
who quickly responds to the needs of all in the face of worldly and spiritual dangers.
Indeed, Tārā is still commonly invoked for this purpose by Tibetan Buddhists, lay and monastic
alike.

While scholars present varying theories on the possible origin of Tārā worship, they tend to
agree that worship of the goddess in India steadily increased in popularity from the sixth
century onward.[2] Whether it be in early descriptions of the goddess—such as in The Root
Manual of the Rites of Mañjuśrī (Toh. 543, Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa, ’jam dpal gyi rtsa ba’i rgyud)[3]
and the frescoes of the Ajanta and Ellora caves[4]—or in her later origin stories,[5]
Tārā is always depicted as Avalokiteśvara’s companion. Jae-Eun Shin and Miranda Shaw argue
that, particularly from the eighth century onward, Tārā gained notable popularity as
an independent deity as she replaced Avalokiteśvara’s role of savior from the eight great
dangers (aṣṭamahābhaya, ’jigs pa chen po brgyad).[6] Nevertheless, texts that are dedicated
solely to Tārā, such as the famous Praise to Tārā with Twenty-One Verses of Homage (Toh.
438, Tārānamaskāraikaviṃśatistotra, sgrol ma la phyag ’tshal nyi shu rtsa gcig gis bstod
pa), repeatedly evoke Tārā’s close connection to Avalokiteśvara.

Tibetan histories recount how the deity Tārā was introduced to Tibet as early as the seventh
century via a sandalwood statue brought by the Nepalese princess Bhṛkutī as dowry for her
future husband, King Songtsen Gampo (srong btsan sgam po, 617–650).[7] While a few texts
dedicated to Tārā were translated in the following centuries,[8] Stephan Beyer argues that
the worship of Tārā did not take firm root in Tibet until the eleventh century when it was
actively promoted by Atiśa (982–1054).[9]

Tārā’s name is a causative derivation from the root √tṝ (“to cross”) whose meaning is “to cause
to cross,” i.e. “to rescue.”  ↩In her PhD dissertation, Rachael Stevens (Stevens 2010)
provides a comprehensive introduction to the goddess Tārā via a literary review (pp. 11–21)
and an exploration of the history of Tārā worship (pp. 20–45), the Tārā pantheon (pp. 46–56)
and key Buddhist texts relating to Tārā (pp. 57–62).  ↩Shin 2010, p. 17.  ↩Ghosh 1980,

’phags pa spyan ras gzigs kyi yum, which, while it does not mention the goddess Tārā,
was nevertheless included within the Degé Kangyur section of Tārā-related scriptures (Toh
724–731) as Toh 725.  ↩Beyer 1978, 5–13; Landesman 2008, 59; Stevens 2010, 36–37.   ↩
